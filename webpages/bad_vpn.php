				<h3> The realities of using vpns </h3>

				<div class="column">
				<h4> What a VPN provider says </h5>
				<p> With Super Free VPN, you can explore the internet without your ISP tracking you. </p>
				<p> With our servers in Uzbeckistan, ensure your data is safe from prying government eyes.</p>
				<p> Public wifi can be dangerous. Hackers can see what you are doing at your local coffee shop. </p>

				<h4> What they actually mean  </h4>
				<p> With Super Freen VPN, you can explore the internet with only us knowing where you go. </p>
				<p> With our servers in Uzbeckistan, good luck arresting us for stealing your account information.</p>
				<p> Public wifi can be dangerous. So send all of your data to us first, before it goes to your bank, your company, or your social media website. </p>
				</div>

				<h3> Conclusion </h3>
				<p> Sending all of your data across the world to a random person's server really isn't a safe bet when it comes to privacy. While your ISP can and probably does log your traffic, you don't gain much out of sending your data to someone else that can just as easily log your data. </p>
				<p> Overall, only use vpns for data you would be okay with your neighbor seeing</p>
